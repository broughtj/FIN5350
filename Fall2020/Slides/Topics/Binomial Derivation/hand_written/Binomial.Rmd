## Introduction

What follows is a derivation of the single--period Binomial option pricing formula.
This derivation is slightly different than the one found in your textbook.  I use different variable names than the text in order
to be more consistent with the Black--Scholes model.


## One-Period Trees

To fix ideas, recall that our simple assumption of binomial prices leads to two
binomial trees: one for the stock price, and one for the option price:


## Stock Price Tree


## Option Price Tree

## The Replicating Portfolio Concept



## Solving for $B$


## Solving for $\Delta$

## The No-Arbitrage Solution
