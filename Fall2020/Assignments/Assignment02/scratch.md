## Initial Thoughts

__Note:__ don't start programming right away. Sketch it out first!

### What Variables De We Need?

- We need a variable to store the most recent largest number that we could not get
- We need a variable to store the current candidate number
- We need a variable to store the count
- We need something to store the package sizes 

## What Functions Do We Need?

- Define: $\mbox{Nugget Number} = a * 6 + b * 9 + c * 20$
- We need a Boolean function called `is_nugget_number`


## What Is Our Stopping Rule?

- When we get six candidates in a row as nugget numbers
- Stopping rule: when we can get six in a row
