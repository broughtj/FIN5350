## __Finance 5350 Class Notes__

## __Topic: The Bernoulli and Binomial Distributions__

\vspace{10mm}


## Introduction

This note is a brief review of concepts from discrete probability. We will cover the definition of a _dicrete random variable_ and 
then turn our attention to a discrete probability distribution called the _Bernoulli Distribution_ as well as its generalization
in the _Binomial Distribution_. 

These notes are based on the presentation in @BainEngelhardt1992.


## Discrete Random Variables

\vspace{2.5mm}

__Definition: Discrete Random Variable__

If the set of all possible values of a random variable, $X$, is a countable set, $x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{n}$, our
$x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots$, then $X$ is called a __discrete random variable__. The function

$$
f(x) = P[X = x] \quad\quad x = x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots
$$

that assigns the probability to each possible value $x$ will be called the __discrete probability density function__ (discrete pdf).


\vspace{20mm}

__Definition: The Bernoulli Distribution__

A random variable , $X$, that assumes only the values $0$ and $1$ is known as a __Bernoulli variable__, and a performance of an 
experiment with only two types of outcomes is called a __Bernoulli trial__. In particular, if an experiment can result only in 
"success" ($E$) or "failure" ($E^{\prime}$), then the corresponding Bernoulli variable is 

$$
X(e) = 
\begin{cases}
1 \quad \mbox{if} \quad e \in E,         \\
0 \quad \mbox{if} \quad e \in E^{\prime}
\end{cases}
$$

The pdf of $X$ is given by $f(0) = 1 - \theta$ and $f(1) = \theta$. The corresponding distribution is known as a __Bernoulli distribution__,
and its pdf can be expressed as 

$$
f(x) = \theta^{x}(1 - \theta)^{1-x} \quad \quad x = 0, 1
$$

__Example: Drawing Marbles at Random__

Consider drawing marbles at random from a collection of $10$ black and $20$ white marbles. In such a problem, we might regard
"black" as success and "white" as failure, or vice versa, in a single draw. If obtaining a black marble is regarded as success, 
then $\theta = 10/30 = 1/3$ and $1 - \theta = 20/30 = 2/3$.

__The Single-Period Binomial Model__

Recall that in the single-period binomial option pricing model we could express it in its risk-neutral form as follows

$$
f_{0} = e^{-r h} [f_{u} p^{\ast} + f_{d} (1 - p^{\ast})]
$$

where $f_{0}$ is value of the option (call or put) and $f_{u}$ is the value of the option in the up state and $f_{d}$ is the value of the option
in the down state. Finally, $p^{\ast} = \frac{e^{(r h)} - u}{u - d}$ was called the ___risk-neutral probability___. This is an example of a single
Beroulli trial with the probability set to the risk-neutral probability.

__A Mathematical Note: The Binomial Coefficient__

The number of combinations of $n$ distinct objects chosen $r$ at a time is

$$
{n \choose r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n - r)!}
$$

__Example:__ 

If five cards are drawn from a deck of cards without replacement, the number of five-card hands is given by

$$
{52 \choose 5} = \frac{52!}{5!47!}
$$

\vspace{10mm}

## __The Binomial Distribution__

An experiment with a sequence of __independent Bernoulli trials__ leads to a generalization of the Bernoulli distribution called the ___Binomial Distribution___. 

\vspace{5mm}

In a sequence of $n$ independent Bernoulli trials with probability of success $p$ on each trial, let $X$ represent the number of successess. The discrete pdf of 
$X$ is given by 

$$
b(x; n, p) = {n \choose x} p^{x} (1-p)^{n-x} \quad \quad x = 0, 1, \ldots, n
$$


\vspace{15mm}

__Relation to the Binomial Options Pricing Model__

The Binomial distribution discrete pdf can be used to calculate the risk-neutral probability of ending up on a given terminal node of the binomial tree. This can 
be seen in Figure 11.8 of @McDonald2012 (see page 333).


\begin{center}

\end{center}

So, for example, one can find out the probability that you would end up on the second node from the top in this three-period tree using the Binomial pdf as follows:

$$
b(2; 3, p^{\ast}) = {n=3 \choose x=2} (p^{\ast})^2 (1 - (p^{\ast})^{3-2} = \frac{3!}{2!1!} (p^{\ast})^{2} (1 - p^{\ast})^{1} = 3 (p^{\ast})^{2} (1 - p^{\ast})
$$

And the probabilities of the other nodes can be found in a like manner for $x = 0, 1, 2, 3$.

__Finding Binomial Probabilities in Python__

One can use the `binom` object from the `scipy.stats` module in Python as follows:

```{python}
from scipy.stats import binom

## Just some placeholder values - substitute your own for actual problems
n = 3
x = 2
p = 0.45
b = binom.pmf(x, n, p)
```
