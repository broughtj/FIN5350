    "### __The Random Walk Model__\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine flipping a coin repeatedly. Let the random variable $Y$ denote the outcome of the flip. If the coin lands a head, $Y = 1$. If the coin lands a tail, $Y = -1$. If the probability of a head is $50\\%$, we say it is a fair coin. After $n$ flips, with the $i^{th}$ flip denoted $Y_{i}$, the cumulative total, $Z_{n}$, is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Z_{n} = \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n} Y_{i}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The more times we flip, on average, the farther we will move from where we start. If you get a head on the first flip you move to $+1$, and as far as the remaining flips are concerned, *this is your new starting point*. After the second flip, you will either be at $0$ or $+2$. If you are a zero it is like starting over, however, if you are at $+2$, you are starting at $+2$. Continuing in this way, your average distance form the starting point increases with the number of flips.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to represent the process followed by $Z_{n}$ is in terms of the *change* in $Z_{n}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Z_{n} - Z_{n-1} = Y_{n}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can represent this more explicitly as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mbox{Heads:} \\quad Z_{n} - Z_{n-1} = +1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mbox{Tails:} \\quad Z_{n} - Z_{n-1} = -1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "With heads the change is $+1$ and with tails the change is $-1$. This is a simple version of a random walk.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea that prices should follow a random walk was introduced by Samuelson (1965). In efficient markets, an asset price should reflect all available information. By definition, new information is a surprise. In response to new information the price is equally likely to move up or down, as with a coin flip. The price after a period of time is the initial price plus the cumulative up and down movements due to informational surprises.\n",
    "\n",
    "### __Modeling Stock Prices as Random Walks__\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea that stock prices should move up or down makes sense; however, the description of a random walk in the previous section is not a satisfactory description of stock price movements. Suppose we take the random walk model literally. Assume the beginning stock price is $\\$100$, and the stock price will move up or down $\\$1$ each time we flip the coin (get an informational surprise). There are at least three problems with this model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If by chance we get enough cumulative down movements, the stock price will become negative. Stockholders have limited liability, so a stock price should never be negative.\n",
    "2. The magnitude of the move ($\\$1$) should depend upon how quickly the coin flips occur and the level of the stock price. If we flip coins once a second, $\\$1$ moves are excessive; in real life, a $\\$100$ stock will not typically have $60$ $\\$1$ up or down moves in $1$ minute. Also, if a $\\$1$ move is appropriate for a $\\$100$ stock, it likely isn't appropriate for a $\\$5$ stock.\n",
    "3. The stock on average should have a positive return. The random walk model taken literally does not permit this.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. The stock price cannot become negative. Even if we move down the Binomial tree many times in a row, the resulting large, negative, continuously compounded return will give us a positive price.\n",
    "2. As stock price moves occur more frequently, $h$ gets smaller, therefore up and down moves get smaller. By construction, annual volatility is the same no matter how many Binomial periods there are. Since returns follow a random walk, the percentage price change is the same whether the stock price is $\\$100$ or $\\$5$.\n",

    "When we traverse the Binomial tree, we are implicitly adding up Binomial random return components of $(r - \\delta)h \\pm \\sigma \\sqrt{h}$. In the limit (as $n \\rightarrow \\infty$ or, the same thing, $h \\rightarrow 0$), the sum of Binomial random variables is normally distributed, which means that the stock price is lognormally distributed. We will discuss this more in Chapters 18 and 20.\n",

    "Suppose that a Binomial tree has $n$ periods and the risk-neutral probability of an up move is $p^{\\ast}$. To reach the top node, we must go up $n$ times in a row, which occurs with a probability of $(p^{\\ast})^{n}$. The price at the top node is $Su^{n}$. There is only one path through the tree by which we can reach the top node. To reach the first node below the top node, we must go up $n-1$ times and down once, for a probability of $(p^{\\ast})^{n-1} \\times (1 - p^{\\ast})$. The price at the top node is $Su^{n-1}d$. Since the single down move can occur in any of the $n$ periods, there are $n$ ways this can happen. The probability of reaching the $i^{th}$ node below the top is $(p^{\\ast})^{n-i} \\times (1 - p^{\\ast})^{i}$. The price at this node is $Su^{n-i}d^{i}$.
